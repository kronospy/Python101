In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

## Before You Begin
Execute cd by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

```bash
/workspaces/Python101 (your-repo-name) $
```
Next execute

```bash
mkdir indoor
```
to make a folder called indoor in your codespace.

Then execute

```bash
cd indoor
```
to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as indoor/ $. You can now execute

```bash
code indoor.py
```

to make a file called indoor.py where you’ll write your program.

## How to Test
Here’s how to test your code manually. At the indoor/ $ prompt in your terminal: :

Run your program with `python indoor.py`. Type `HELLO` and press `Enter`. Your program should output `hello`.
Run your program with `python indoor.py`. Type `THIS IS PYTHON` and press `Enter`. Your program should output `this is python`.
Run your program with `python indoor.py` Type `40` and press Enter. Your program should output `50`.
